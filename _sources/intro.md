<em>“Your goal shouldn't be to buy players. Your goal should be to buy wins. In order buy wins, you need to buy runs.” - Peter Brand, Moneyball</em>

For many baseball fans, predicting which team will win the World Series is always the topic on the beer table before each season. Gossips about which player moved to which team or which player will bounce back from the previous season quickly leads to heated arguments, often testing the loyalty to the team or the player. Stepping aside from these arguments momentarily, I often asked myself a question – **‘How should the team strategize to ultimately win the World Series?’** Peter Brand from <em> Moneyball</em> had an unwavering yet highly unorthodox belief in acquiring players solely based on their on-base percentage. Is this a sound judgment? How about other elements of the game such as securing top performing starting pitchers, improving team’s defense performance, or having heavy hitters in the line-up? My mini-project here is the attempt to answer such questions and determine **which qualities are the most important ones for the team to secure the World Series title by the end of the season.**
